# CREDIT EDA Data Science Project

## Introduction
The CREDIT EDA data science project involves analyzing credit risk using various statistical and machine learning techniques. This project aims to predict whether a customer will default on their loan repayment based on various factors.

## Steps Involved in the Project
1. Data Collection: Gather data from reliable sources such as financial institutions or credit bureaus. This dataset should include information about customers, their loan applications, and historical payment behavior.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform an initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, identify missing values, outliers, and potential patterns or relationships between variables.

3. Data Preprocessing: Cleanse the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This could involve imputing missing values, removing outliers, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

4. Feature Engineering: Create new features that might improve predictive power by extracting relevant information from existing variables or combining them intelligently.

5. Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for credit risk prediction based on the problem requirements and available resources. Common choices include logistic regression, decision trees/random forests, support vector machines (SVM), or gradient boosting models.

6. Model Training: Split the dataset into training and validation sets to train the selected models using appropriate evaluation metrics (such as accuracy or area under the receiver operating characteristic curve).

7. Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using various metrics (e.g., precision/recall/F1-score) on the validation set to determine how well it generalizes to unseen data.

8. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters through techniques like grid search or random search within a predefined parameter space.

9. Final Model Selection: Select the best-performing model based on evaluation results obtained during cross-validation or holdout testing procedures.

10.Model Deployment: Implement the final model into a production environment, ensuring seamless integration and performance optimization.

11. Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor the deployed model's performance to identify any potential drift or degradation over time. Regularly update the model with new data and retrain as needed to maintain its accuracy.

## Conclusion
The CREDIT EDA data science project involves a comprehensive analysis of credit risk, starting from data collection to model deployment. By following these steps, one can develop an accurate credit risk prediction system that assists in making informed lending decisions.
